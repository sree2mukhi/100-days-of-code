# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 05, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Build a HTML and CSS static page for Filter Application

**Thoughts:** I have previously worked with CSS and HTML, so it was not that difficult to form a basic prototype for the filter application that I have in mind.

### Day 1: May 06, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on CodeChef Problems

**Thoughts:** I tried attempting the May long challenge, to say the laest it was challenging, I understood what I needed to do, but my code still has bugs. I need to work more on my Algorithms.
