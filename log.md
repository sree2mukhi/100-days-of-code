### Day 2: May 06, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on CodeChef Problems

**Thoughts:** I tried attempting the May long challenge, to say the laest it was challenging, I understood what I needed to do, but my code still has bugs. I need to work more on my Algorithms.

### Day 3: May 07, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Tweeked the HTML and CSS Page, worked on Project Euler
